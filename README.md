Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-ray Images: A
Game Changer in Improving Diagnosis and Patient Outcomes


# Project Description

Pneumonia is a major global health concern and it
is a deadly illness for older adults. India
contributes 23% of this disease. For detecting
pneumonia accurately chest X-ray plays an
important role but checking chest X-rays manually
is time-consuming and requires a specialist. But as
the technologies are evolving the detection of these
types of disease become quite easy. Recent years
have shown a great revolution in detecting diseases
related to the lungs. In this study, we explore the
effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), including MobileNetV2, VGG-16, and
ResNet-50, in the detection of pneumonia from
chest X-ray images. Through a comprehensive
comparative analysis, we evaluate the performance
of these CNN architectures in terms of accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity. Out of these four
models, MobileNetV2 is performing best based on
accuracy in detection and it has an accuracy rate of
97% in classifying pneumonia and non-pneumonia
images. It is found that MobileNetV2 consistently
shows good performance across various evaluation
metrics, showing high sensitivity and specificity in
pneumonia detection tasks. This emphasizes the
potential of MobileNetV2 as a reliable tool for
pneumonia diagnosis, offering promising prospects
for improving healthcare outcomes and resource
allocation in clinical settings.

## Methodology

At first chest x-ray images are taken as a dataset. It
consists of viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,
and also normal chest X-ray images. For image
pre-processing data augmentation is performed
over the dataset to increase the diversity of the
images. Thereafter CNN, VGG-16, MobileNetV2,
and ResNet-50 four deep learning models are
trained and at last, it will be checked which model
performs better in terms of accuracy and detection.
